Welcome to the Maemo Leste website; Maemo Leste continues the legacy
of `Maemo <http://maemo.org/>`_. We aim to provide a free Maemo experience on
mobile phones and tablets like the Nokia N900, Motorola Droid 4, Allwinner
Tablets and more.

Feel free to join us on irc.freenode.net **#maemo-leste** and also join our
`mailing list
<https://mailinglists.dyne.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/maemo-leste>`_ if you're
interested.

Maemo Leste is based on Devuan Ascii (Debian Stretch) and all the "supported"
devices ship with recent Linux (mainline-based) kernels. We are also already
working towards supporting Devuan Beowulf (Debian Buster) as well.

The project is not usable as a daily driver for your device, Maemo Leste is
currently in development phase and we are actively searching for developers. For
some devices, we have development images available - such as the `Nokia N900
<https://leste.maemo.org/Nokia_N900>`_; for an impression see
`Screenshots <{filename}/pages/screenshots.rst>`_.

So far we have set up devuan/debian repositories for our packages, with builds
for `armel`, `armhf`, `amd64`, `aarch64`. We have FOSS replacements for some
closed maemo packages (and we have no closed packages in use), further building
on the Maemo community efforts to replace all closed bits by open software.

Installation guides are provided per device. For open tasks/issues, please see
the bugtracker: https://github.com/maemo-leste/bugtracker/issues.
