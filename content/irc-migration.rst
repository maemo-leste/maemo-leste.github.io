Due to the recent events that have happened with FOSS communities and
the Freenode IRC network, we've decided to move our channel to the new,
community-maintained `Libera.chat IRC network <https://libera.chat>`_.

We have hopefully updated all our previous writings, and wiki entries,
but if you find any remains of Freenode, let us know so we can change
it.

See you on Libera IRC! :)
