A couple of months ago we were made aware of the `DAPSI
<https://dapsi.ngi.eu>`_ project by our dear Michiel of `NLnet
<https://nlnet.nl>`_. DAPSI is one of the projects in the scope of the
European Union's `Next Generation Internet <https://www.ngi.eu>`_
initiative and it offers funding for projects that research data
portability and privacy solutions to give people better control over
their personal data.

Seeing this, we managed to think about a few ideas of how this
context could fit in Maemo Leste. We managed to write an application and apply
to the open call just before the deadline.

A month or so later, we were contacted by the DAPSI team to tell us that our
application passed and that we are going to receive funding for the milestones
we chose to apply with! Obviously, this is fantastic news for us and it helps
us make Maemo Leste sustainable and future proof.

The research we are planning to do in the scope of this grant is
very interesting and will bring some much needed features to the Maemo
ecosystem. We plan to develop various applets that will seamlessly
integrate Tor, Wireguard, and OpenVPN into the system and enable a new
layer of security and privacy for our community and users.

Further on, we will also work on communication integration via the Telepathy
framework. More concretely, in the scope of DAPSI, we will work on various interfaces:
XMPP, GNU Jami, Matrix, and Signal messenger. These should all be
able to work with Telepathy as the core, and give us a way to test
and develop a generic graphical user interface to all these protocols in Maemo.

Finally, we will develop a system library for interoperable sharing of
files which will allow us to transfer and share files through various
protocols that the system supports, e.g. the above-mentioned.

We have to say we're very happy about this research we're going to
do and hope that it will speed up some much-needed development that
needs to happen.

Also, we've gathered enough news to write another update/status post
of the current state of Maemo Leste, so you can expect that one soon
as well!
