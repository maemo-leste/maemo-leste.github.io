<p>It's been a month since our <a class="reference external" href="https://maemo-leste.github.io/maemo-leste-standing-on-the-shoulders-of-giants.html">first post</a> and there's a
lot of stuff to talk about!</p>
<p>First of all, someone added us to <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maemo#Maemo-Leste">Wikipedia</a>, cool!</p>
<p>Devuan, the distribution that Maemo Leste is based on, has released a beta
version of &quot;Devuan ASCII&quot; (Devuan 2.0): <a class="reference external" href="https://files.devuan.org/devuan_ascii_beta/README.txt">https://files.devuan.org/devuan_ascii_beta/README.txt</a>
Maemo Leste uses Devuan Ascii, so we're happy to see ASCII being close to
a release.</p>
<div class="section" id="on-the-software-side">
<h2>On the software side</h2>
<p>We have imported various new packages, added new device images, and have been
working on fixing and enhancing existing packages.</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">We have ported the community-ssu battery applet from <cite>hal</cite> to <cite>UPower</cite>, and it
is now available as an update (via apt) and installed by default in the new
images.  (See <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/bugtracker/issues/36">#36</a>)
There are still some open issues (
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/bugtracker/issues/90">#90</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/bugtracker/issues/67">#67</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/bugtracker/issues/68">#68</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/bugtracker/issues/70">#70</a>)</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The battery applet work also uncovered some kernel bugs. The first one related
to the status of the battery not being correct. This bug was fixed shortly
after the bug was reported, with patches in this thread: <a class="reference external" href="https://marc.info/?l=linux-pm&amp;m=151933105213158&amp;w=2">N900 battery status
fixes</a>.
Another issue was uncovered when the battery applet seemed to get charging
events with a very long delay (60s+). The patch is currently on the mailing
list, but will hopefully make its way into the kernel after it has gotten some
review: <a class="reference external" href="https://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&amp;m=151994358415447&amp;w=2">[RFC PATCH] power: supply: bq27xxx: Call power_supply_changed on
status change</a>.</p>
<img alt="" src="/images/n900-charging-battery-applet.png" style="width: 576px; height: 324px;" />
</li>
<li><p class="first">The usb status bar has received some initial porting work from <cite>hal</cite> to
<cite>udev</cite>, and now the UI will pop up when the N900 (only supported device right
now) is connected to a PC.  Actually changing the USB gadgets does not yet
work, since we intend to switch to <cite>configfs</cite> and <cite>libusbgx</cite> instead of the
deprecated gadget modes, so that we can also provide more complex gadgets in
the near future, see
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/bugtracker/issues/39">#39</a>.
While porting the applet, a few kernel bugs were uncovered. The first problem
was that reading the <cite>vbus</cite> status from sysfs caused kernel OOPSes. This
should be fixed with this patch: <a class="reference external" href="https://marc.info/?l=linux-omap&amp;m=151977053826963&amp;w=2">[PATCH v2 1/1] usb: musb: call
pm_runtime_{get,put}_sync before reading vbus registers</a>.
The second issue is that sometimes the <cite>mode</cite> file in the <cite>musb-hdrc</cite>
controller will return <cite>(null)</cite> rather than a sensible mode (e.g. <cite>b_idle</cite>,
<cite>b_peripheral</cite>, etc). This has been reported here: <a class="reference external" href="https://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&amp;m=151994805016878&amp;w=2">usb: musb: &quot;(null)&quot; in
sysfs mode file after disabling a gadget (and at other times, system hangs)</a>. As the title
suggests, at other times the device would simply reboot when switching to
another gadget. So there's more work to be done in this area.</p>
<img alt="" src="/images/leste-initial-usb-applet.png" style="width: 576px; height: 324px;" />
</li>
<li><p class="first">The system menu and lock screen mostly works, but doesn't work directly from
startup on the N900. This is likely a boot (race) condition triggered in part
by the fact that <cite>hildon-desktop</cite> currently starts slowly.  See <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/bugtracker/issues/83">#83</a>, and meanwhile, enjoy
screenshots of working UI:</p>
<img alt="" src="/images/n900-lock-slider.png" style="width: 576px; height: 324px;" />
<img alt="" src="/images/n900-system-menu.png" style="width: 576px; height: 324px;" />
</li>
<li><p class="first">To be able to quickly get some of these kernel fixes to Maemo Leste, we have
git repositories with some device specific kernel patches. Now, at least for
the N900, we also have a package: <cite>linux-image-n900 - Linux kernel package for
Nokia N900 (4.15)</cite>. It currently already carries all of the fixes mentioned
above.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The orientation lock applet is also ported, but has yet to see any reasonable
testing, see
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/bugtracker/issues/37">#37</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">The <cite>Mode Control Entity</cite> (mce) can now control the backlight on the Droid4,
and likely on almost every other device with Linux mainline support out there,
see <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/bugtracker/issues/65">#65</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><cite>mce</cite> can now read the battery status using <cite>UPower</cite>, profiting from earlier
work done on the battery applet, see
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/bugtracker/issues/87">#87</a>&gt;</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><cite>ofono</cite> no longer crashes, as reported in
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/bugtracker/issues/61">#61</a>. We have also
imported the latest ofono release, since the required version was not yet
present in Debian sid (nor in Devuan).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">With some work, <cite>ofono</cite> can be used to set up a <cite>2g/3g</cite> data connection, as
described in <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/bugtracker/issues/61">#61</a>. It is also possible to send a text and start a phone
call, using dbus. The phone call is without audio. At present, there is no
integration or UI available in Maemo Leste for any of this.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><a class="reference external" href="http://maedevu.maemo.org/images/droid4/">Motorola Droid4 images are now available</a>, but be mindful that you need
to have already rooted the device and to have installed safestrap.
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/bugtracker/issues/26">#26</a>
We hope that someone will volunteer to extend our current device pages with
installation instructions, or at least pointers to said instructions (see
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/bugtracker/issues/75">#75</a>).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">There are also <a class="reference external" href="http://maedevu.maemo.org/images/olimex-lime2/">LIME2 images available</a>. Like the Droid4 image, they
do not yet contain any hardware acceleration. At present, the LIME2 images
also require that a HDMI monitor is hooked up at boot time. (If someone tries
out the images, please document your experience and consider adding to our
devices pages). There is an open issue that contains the current state of the
images: <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/bugtracker/issues/43">#43</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">There are now also <cite>armel</cite> images available for the N900, but <strong>they do not
yet work</strong>, so please stick to <cite>armhf</cite> images for now.
See <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/bugtracker/issues/92">#92</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Our repositories were missing source packages for many packages, so <cite>apt-get
build-dep</cite> and <cite>apt-get source</cite> often did not work. This is now resolved, see
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/bugtracker/issues/84">#84</a>.</p>
<p>Several people have inquired about a &quot;Scratchbox&quot; like tool. Currently,
development is done on the devices themselves, or virtual machines. You can
simply use the standard Debian development tools for all development and
packaging, so at this point there does not seem to be a reason to develop a
Scratchbox-like environment.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">A <strong>lot</strong> of work has gone into readying <cite>connui</cite> and <cite>icd2</cite> (the connectivity
UI, API, daemon and plugins) for Maemo Leste. Unfortunately, it is not in a
completed state yet, but it's getting quite close. More on that later on in
this post.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>More work has been done behind the scenes, so if you're excited, please do
follow our github issue tracker and/or the IRC channel. We also have logs of the
channel history now: <a class="reference external" href="http://maedevu.maemo.org/irc.txt">http://maedevu.maemo.org/irc.txt</a></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-is-next">
<h2>What is next?</h2>
<p>We have started to use the Github 'Milestones' feature to sort tickets by order
of importance and feasibility, and you can see the ticket that we deem necessary
for an Alpha releases here: <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/bugtracker/milestone/4">Alpha release milestone</a>.</p>
<p>A lot of major things are still missing. A few obvious ones are phone calls, UI
and daemons for conversations, integration for wifi connectivity, integration
for 3g data, 3d acceleration for various supported platforms, support for Qt
applications and some sort of Android application support. We will try to cover
what we're going to work on for the next month, to give you an indication on
where we are, where we are going, and where you can help.</p>
<div class="section" id="connectivity">
<h3>Connectivity</h3>
<p>The first big thing that we want to attempt to get into a working state is
<cite>connui</cite>, <cite>icd2</cite> and <cite>wpa_supplicant</cite> integration for <cite>icd2</cite>. In layman terms:
we want wifi to work with the Maemo Fremantle UIs. To do this, we need to finish reverse
engineering the last bits of <cite>connui</cite>, and then we need to write a plugin for
<cite>icd2</cite> that communicates with <cite>wpa_supplicant</cite>, the de-facto wifi daemon. (See
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/bugtracker/issues/73">#73</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/bugtracker/issues/42">#42</a>)
We will need someone to finish the <cite>icd2</cite> documentation in doxygen format: <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/bugtracker/issues/28">#28</a></p>
<p>Similarly, we would also need someone to take a look at what the best way would
be to integrate ofono into our networking stack. One method to do that would be
to integrate it into icd2, but perhaps there are also alternatives, by using
<cite>NetworkManager</cite> or <cite>connui</cite>, and somehow hooking those up to <cite>icd2</cite>.</p>
<p>Having working phone calls with audio (even with perhaps not too great audio
quality) would be a huge win and might not be too far out, we're hoping someone
will pick this up, see <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/bugtracker/issues/27">#27</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="android-in-a-box">
<h3>Android in a box</h3>
<p>The best way to run Android applications on GNU/Linux seems to be <a class="reference external" href="https://anbox.io/">Anbox</a>, which is in the process in being packaged for Debian (and
Devuan): <a class="reference external" href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=884797">https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=884797</a>
We have a ticket for anbox support, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/bugtracker/issues/9">#9</a>.</p>
<p>We do not yet know how much RAM anbox would use and if it is feasible for all
our supported devices, but devices such as the LIME2 and the Motorola Droid 4
might have enough RAM to spare to run Android applications using Anbox.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="drivers-and-packaging">
<h3>Drivers and packaging</h3>
<p>Having 3D acceleration work on the LIME2 devices would be quite nice, since they
can output to high resolution screens, in which case 3D acceleration is really a
must-have <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/bugtracker/issues/43">#43</a>.</p>
<p>The Droid 4 also currently has no 3D acceleration. We hope that a more
lightweight version of <cite>hildon-desktop</cite> can provide some solace here <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/bugtracker/issues/51">#51</a>.</p>
<p>Finishing the USB gadget code is definitely a short term goal, but that depends
on how fast we can get the kernel bugs resolved.</p>
<p>Another thing we want to wrap up soon is importing the Maemo Qt patches (
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/bugtracker/issues/53">#53</a>), since that will
allow us (and hopefully, others) to import many more packages from Maemo
Fremantle. Examples of such packages are clockui (<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/bugtracker/issues/55">#55</a>), osso-calculator (<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/bugtracker/issues/54">#54</a>) and open media player
(<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/bugtracker/issues/25">#25</a>).</p>
<p>Packaging <cite>pulseaudio</cite> is also somewhere on the road map, which might be
required for better call quality on the N900 and also to protect the N900
speakers from being irrepairably damaged <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/bugtracker/issues/62">#62</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="platform-support">
<h3>Platform support</h3>
<p>We might look at supporting <cite>arm64</cite> in the near future, if we have a (virtual)
device that we can test our builds on.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="interested">
<h2>Interested?</h2>
<p>If you're interested in specifics, or helping out, or wish to have a specific
package ported, please see our <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/bugtracker">bugtracker</a>.</p>
<p>Join us! We really need more people helping out. At this point, we specifically
need developers who can work on porting packages, help out with reverse
engineering, and debug driver issues.</p>
<p>We're currently on irc.freenode.net in #maemo-leste, but also hang out in
#maemo. We also monitor the github issues closely.</p>
