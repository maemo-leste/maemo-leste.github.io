<h2>Daedalus</h2>
<p>We ported Maemo Leste to Devuan Daedalus (Debian bookworm) some time ago (see <a class="reference external" href="https://git.maemo.org/leste/bugtracker/issues/751">issue
#571</a>) and silently
switched our images over to this release. At the time we were caught up
on Debian stable, but as of writing of this post, Debian bookworm is now old
stable again. One of our priorities is to switch to Devuan Excalibur (Debian
Trixie) soon, so that we are on Debian stable.</p>
<p>It has taken us while but we are slowly catching up to the Debian release
cycles - these things take time because we have to port our packages to newer
libraries and code, and when we started Maemo Leste we were targetting a
distribution that was then already olstable.</p>
<p>As part of the upgrade to Daedalus, we:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>ported our media application framework <a class="reference external" href="https://git.maemo.org/leste/mafw-tracker-source/commit/c0e38e4eb46e2aa2492bfedb983956bb50c4b79d">to use Tracker 3</a></li>
<li>rebased our Xorg patches on the debian xorg</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://git.maemo.org/leste/dependency-resolver">wrote a piece of software</a>
to figure out in what order to build our packages in
Jenkins, as this historically has been somewhat of a challenge</li>
<li>Decreased the number of upstream software that we had to fork, as our patches
made it upstream in some cases</li>
<li>migrate away from python2 in <a class="reference external" href="https://git.maemo.org/leste/maemo-system-services/commit/4fc8f17d9dfb55eacc573be856054f18e3e08961">icd2 module management</a>.</li>
<li>Switched to a newer upstream upower version which contains <a class="reference external" href="https://git.maemo.org/leste-upstream-forks/upower/commit/1df483b7608fcdd8e69b9968fe85b42a112cab18">most of our patches</a>;</li>
</ul>
<p>The actual set of changes is much larger and can be seen in <a class="reference external" href="https://git.maemo.org/leste/bugtracker/issues/751">issue #571</a>.</p>
<div class="section" id="jenkins-and-versioning">
<h3>Jenkins and Versioning</h3>
<p>When we first made the <tt class="docutils literal">chimaera</tt> release, we made a mistake in how we version
the packages, normally our packages end in something like: <tt class="docutils literal">+4m7</tt> - which means
&quot;distribution release 4,  Maemo 7&quot;. In the <tt class="docutils literal">chimaera</tt> case, the <tt class="docutils literal">4</tt> felloff.
Unfortunately in Debian packaging versioning this means that the <tt class="docutils literal">chimaera</tt>
versions without this one-digit prefix always take precendence over the packages
with this additional prefix. In an attempt to make dist-upgrading possible, we <a class="reference external" href="https://git.maemo.org/leste/leste-config/commit/4c4de8c405f3ce5a10e35d1d16b5f76de9f7215e">added a file
to apt.preferences.d</a> that gives the packages <tt class="docutils literal">daedalus</tt> release repository a
higher priority than the <tt class="docutils literal">chimaera</tt> ones. We <a class="reference external" href="https://git.maemo.org/leste/jenkins-integration/commit/8e6c21127e46c9975ab985dab699f50b3dc50027">also fixed the problem in Jenkins</a>
although this doesn't really matter at this point, as the chimaera versions are
already problematic.</p>
<p>This <a class="reference external" href="https://git.maemo.org/leste/jenkins-integration/commit/9802ed8e969ac209f2358d1f04683556423fb5eb">commit to jenkins-integration</a>
adds the proper versioning for Daedalus and we also fixed some IRC integration
script for packages that are only built for one architecture in <a class="reference external" href="https://git.maemo.org/leste/jenkins-integration/commit/b00ad4d9070861413fcc5f915272ebd58157dd4f">commit b00ad4d9</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="dist-upgrading">
<h3>dist-upgrading</h3>
<p>As always, installing a <tt class="docutils literal">daedalus</tt> image is the easiest way to get up to date,
but it is possible to dist-upgrade from <tt class="docutils literal">chimaera</tt> to <tt class="docutils literal">daedalus</tt>, but one has to
ensure that the repositories in <tt class="docutils literal">/etc/apt/sources.list</tt> and
<tt class="docutils literal">/etc/apt/sources.list.d/*</tt> have their <tt class="docutils literal">chimaera</tt> references removed. Make sure
you're fully up to date on <tt class="docutils literal">chimaera</tt> first.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="core">
<h2>Core</h2>
<p>Various core applications and daemons have seen improvements and fixes.</p>
<div class="section" id="browser-jib">
<h3>Browser (jib)</h3>
<p>Jib now has full-support for the virtual keyboard, so that this browser is also usable
from devices with no hardware keyboard. In addition, we've improved the built-in
adblocker, so it does not block benign resources.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="calendar">
<h3>Calendar</h3>
<p>We've fixed the vertical alignment in the month display for the calendar, see
<a class="reference external" href="https://git.maemo.org/leste/qalendar/pulls/1">qalendar/pulls/1</a>.</p>
<img alt="" src="/images/qalendar-vertical-alignment.png" style="width: 531px; height: 407px;" />
</div>
<div class="section" id="ntp">
<h3>ntp</h3>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">sicelo</tt> made it such that we when we fetch the time over NTP, we also
synchronise it to our hardware clock, see <a class="reference external" href="https://git.maemo.org/leste/leste-config/pulls/61">leste-config/pulls/61</a></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conversations">
<h3>Conversations</h3>
<p>Conversations has received a lot of attention - bringing you new, and exciting
features for our Daedalus release.</p>
<div class="section" id="maemo-fi-cation">
<h4>Maemo-fi-cation</h4>
<p>Conversations now uses more UI components (and paradigms) from Fremantle.</p>
<p>The settings and about page were moved to a popup.</p>
<img alt="" src="/images/conv_settings.png" style="width: 576px; height: 324px;" />
<p>We are now also using a dialog for the contact picker (Compose new message).</p>
<p>The maemo-fi-cation of our UI is still on-going, and will be expanded with more
Maemo components in the future.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="improved-tableview">
<h4>Improved tableview</h4>
<p>We have various places where messages are listed: the overview (the first screen), search window, and the groupchat
memberlist window. Code-wise, we are now using the same table everywhere.</p>
<p>In addition, we improved this table's sorting, avatar/presence visualization, , and made table updates more performant.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ux-improvements">
<h4>UX improvements</h4>
<p>When writing a long message, the input box now dynamically grows according to input.</p>
<img alt="" src="/images/conv_expand.png" style="width: 576px; height: 324px;" />
<p>The QML interface has been reworked to be more responsive. This was already
the case, but there was still the occasional clipping bug.</p>
<p>In portrait, everything now properly scales, and adjusts:</p>
<img alt="" src="/images/conv_responsive.png" style="width: 324px; height: 576px;" />
<p>Some other improvements related to the chat window are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Improved 'bottom pinning' on incoming messages</li>
<li>Support key combination shift+enter to introduce a newline whilst 'auto-send on ENTER' is enabled</li>
<li>Set focus directly after sending a message</li>
<li>Optional shader for chat bubble backgrounds, similar to a well-known chat application</li>
<li>Optional shader for the background: matrix falling rain</li>
</ul>
<img alt="" src="/images/conv_matrix.png" style="width: 576px; height: 324px;" />
</div>
<div class="section" id="slim-mode">
<h4>Slim mode</h4>
<p>Conversations is designed to run on low-powered devices, with possibly old(er) hardware. As such,
conversations is written in C++, and leverages various tricks to keep memory usage low, and performance fast.</p>
<p>While the regular QML interface is already minimal in terms of resource usage, we have introduced 'slim'
mode for a minimalistic, alternative QtWidgets based interface. This can be enabled in the settings.</p>
<p>Since Conversation's core logic was already separate from presentation, supporting this alternative interface
required minimal changes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="attachments">
<h4>Attachments</h4>
<p>We now parse incoming and outgoing links, and render these links depending on their
content type. In the case of XMPP, when someone sends a picture - this is generally just a
link to a <tt class="docutils literal">.jpg</tt>. Conversations now renders them inline.</p>
<p>Additionally there is also an image viewer that supports gestures like panning,
and zooming to further inspect incoming media.</p>
<p>By default, this feature is off for privacy reasons (as to prevent auto-visiting
weblinks sent by a counterparty), but can
be turned on in the settings.</p>
<img alt="" src="/images/conv_attachment2.png" style="width: 576px; height: 324px;" />
</div>
<div class="section" id="address-book-integration">
<h4>Address book integration</h4>
<p>Our initial address book integration introduced features like avatars and
display names. We've now expanded this to also support 'master contacts'.</p>
<p>Master contacts unify contacts from multiple sources such as XMPP, Matrix, and
SMS into a single contact.</p>
<p>By keeping contact management (osso-abook) and messaging (Conversations)
separate, Maemo ensures that the address book integrates across the entire
system. This allows applications to share a consistent, unified view of contacts
while keeping the messaging layer focused on communication.</p>
<p>Additionally, the code responsible for interacting with the address book has
seen major improvements, resulting in better performance.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="channel-member-list">
<h4>Channel member list</h4>
<p>Groupchats now expose a memberlist, from which you can start a private
conversation with a contact.</p>
<img alt="" src="/images/conv_memberlist.png" style="width: 324px; height: 576px;" />
<p>Since the memberlist could be quite long, it has the ability to filter for
specific names.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="qt5">
<h3>Qt5</h3>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">Sander</tt> has made it so that the Hildon Input Method (HIM) now works well in
Qt, which means that devices without keyboard have access to a usable virtual
keyboard. This work can be found in <a class="reference external" href="https://git.maemo.org/leste/qt-input-maemo">leste/qt-input-maemo</a> and is very exciting.</p>
<p>Additionally, the qt menu is now always shown properly (see <a class="reference external" href="https://git.maemo.org/leste/bugtracker/issues/563">issue #563</a>).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="qt6-platform-plugins">
<h3>Qt6 platform plugins</h3>
<p>Leste has various Qt plugins to make Qt applications integrate with the
operating system. These change the look, and behavior of Qt applications, and
make them more suitable for e.g. touchscreen devices.</p>
<p>Qt6 is the new Qt version, so the various plugins needed a migration to this new
version.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Each had their qmake converted to CMake, in order for better integration with existing IDEs</li>
<li>Each are now separate repositories to make development more focussed, and accessible</li>
<li>Each now have a Qt GUI example application - handy for testing any changes made to the plugin in question</li>
</ul>
<p>We are happy to report Qt6 applications now also integrate into Maemo, just like
our Qt5 applications do.</p>
<div class="section" id="qt6-input-maemo">
<h4>qt6-input-maemo</h4>
<p>This the keyboard integration, including the virtual keyboard. Since our Qt5
version was already using modern Qt (having been ported from Qt4 only recently),
minimal changes where needed to get this working on Qt6, see <a class="reference external" href="https://git.maemo.org/leste/qt6-input-maemo">qt6-input-maemo</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="qt6-qpa-maemo">
<h4>qt6-qpa-maemo</h4>
<p>This plugin is responsible for integrating with xcb/x11, and offers glx (opengl)
and egl (opengles) backends for hardware acceleration. It also deals with things
like drag &amp; drop, and clipboard. Porting this was somewhat challenging due to Qt
plugin infrastructure changes, as well as debugging hardware acceleration on the
various devices we support, see <a class="reference external" href="https://git.maemo.org/leste/qt6-qpa-maemo/">qt6-qpa-maemo</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="qt6-maemo-widgets">
<h4>qt6-maemo-widgets</h4>
<p>This plugin provides additional Maemo components (widgets) for Qt, like
<cite>QMaemo5InformationBox</cite>, <cite>QMaemo5DatePickSelector</cite>, see <a class="reference external" href="https://git.maemo.org/leste/qt6-maemo-widgets">qt6-maemo-widgets</a>.</p>
<p>Previously part of the plugin, this is now a shared library that produces a
pkgconfig, and CMake config for other Qt apps to consume.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="qt6-style-maemo">
<h4>qt6-style-maemo</h4>
<p>This plugin deals with how Qt applications look. For example, when this plugin
is active, a <cite>QButton</cite> is replaced by a GTK button at runtime. It does so by
painting GTK widgets into Qt widgets. This plugin also handles spacing, size
hints, and color palettes. Due to Qt plugin infrastructure changes, this was
somewhat time consuming to migrate, see <a class="reference external" href="https://git.maemo.org/leste/qt6-style-maemo/">qt6-style-maemo</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="sphone">
<h3>sphone</h3>
<p>Our dialer software has also seen some improvements:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The default ringtones are now ogg files (<a class="reference external" href="https://git.maemo.org/leste/bugtracker/issues/767">issue #767</a>)</li>

<li>Color scheme presets (Black-on-white, White-on-black, ...)</li>
<li>Custom color scheme with working preview buttons</li>
<li>Use color picker from Hildon Extras</li>
<li>Remove &quot;Reverse&quot; option (it just swaps fg/bg color)</li>
<li>Make scrollback a picker instead of a text field</li>

<h3>Motorola Droid 4</h3>
<p>The mapphones (Motorola Droid 4, Motorola Bionic, Motorola Droid RAZR, Motorola
Droid 3, Motorola Atrix 2, various xoom/xyboard tablets), received significant
improvements. In particular, the cellular stack (in the form of ofono) has seen
various improvements, improving the stability of the cellular stack and reducing
the amount of custom code by <a class="reference external" href="https://git.maemo.org/leste-upstream-forks/ofono/commit/058db24b7201ce7f087d5c4ea38937d28d52c999">migrating to QMI from custom AT commands</a>

<h3>Pinephone</h3>
<p>Display brightness now correctly adjusts according to the user

<h2>Forgejo</h2>
<p>We <a class="reference external" href="https://maemo-leste.github.io/maemo-leste-forgejo-migration.html">migrated away from Github to Forgejo</a> and now run our own Git forge on
<tt class="docutils literal">git.maemo.org</tt>. This in turn has made it easier for us customise our Git
forge.</p>
<div class="section" id="code-search">
<h3>Code search</h3>
<p>Full text code search is enabled on <tt class="docutils literal">git.maemo.org</tt>, which makes it very easy to
quickly search our entire codebase.</p>
<p>We have been working with the Forgejo developers to add the option to enable and
disable the code indexer per repository, as we want to avoid indexing our
various Linux repositories, you can track this work on <a class="reference external" href="https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/pulls/8106">forgejo/pulls/8106</a>.</p>

<div class="section" id="translations-with-weblate">
<h3>Translations with weblate</h3>
<p>Pushing updates from weblate to our <tt class="docutils literal">l10n</tt> repositories was broken after the
migration from Forgejo to Github - this has now been resolved with translations
being pushed directly to our <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git.maemo.org/leste-translations</span></tt> repositories.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="continous-integration">
<h3>Continous integration</h3>
<p>Historically Maemo Leste has used Jenkins for all its package building, which
has been a bit complex to manage permissions on and add packages to. So we have
been working on adding a CI system using Forgejo which allows us to
automatically.  The Forgejo CI system is similar to 'Github Actions', and we
currently:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>build a package for every commit that gets pushed;</li>
<li>deploy extras packages to the <a class="reference external" href="https://git.maemo.org/leste-extras/-/packages">extras-testing</a> repository on Forgejo. This
repository is present on the devices but disabled by default.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a result, community members can now push out updates of their own software
more easily - and even automatically to the <a class="reference external" href="https://git.maemo.org/leste-extras/-/packages">extras-testing</a> repository. The
<a class="reference external" href="https://git.maemo.org/leste-extras/-/packages">extras-testing</a> repository is available in the Hildon Application Manager, but
disabled by default.</p>
<p>We have set up runners for <tt class="docutils literal">amd64</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">armhf</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">arm64</tt>, so these runners
are all available to the CI/CD. Below is an example page of actions ran on the
<tt class="docutils literal">maemo/daedalus</tt> branch, which will build packages automatically for the
daedalus testing repository.</p>
<img alt="" src="/images/actions.png" />
<p>The screenshot below shows the build status of various packages on the <a class="reference external" href="https://git.maemo.org/org/leste-extras/dashboard">Forgejo
extras dashboard</a>.</p>
<img alt="" src="/images/issue-897-screenshot.png" />
<div class="section" id="workflows">
<h4>Workflows</h4>
<p>The CI mentioned just above is powered by our newly developed
<a class="reference external" href="https://git.maemo.org/leste-cicd/forgejo-workflows">leste-cicd/forgejo-workflows</a> repository, which
contains two actions:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://git.maemo.org/leste-cicd/forgejo-workflows/src/branch/master/.forgejo/workflows/maemo-entry.yml">maemo-entry.yml</a>: a resuable action which builds a package for each
architecture and uploads them if they are in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">leste-extras</span></tt></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://git.maemo.org/leste-cicd/forgejo-workflows/src/branch/master/maemo-build/action.yml">maemo-build/action.yml</a>: composite action that builds a package</li>
</ul>
<p>The uploading of the packages into our Forgejo extras debian registry is done
using our custom <a class="reference external" href="https://git.maemo.org/leste-cicd/include-artifact">leste-cicd/include-artifact</a> action.</p>
<p>Further details on the extras workflow can be found in <a class="reference external" href="https://git.maemo.org/leste/bugtracker/issues/798">issue #798</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="container-base-images">
<h4>Container base images</h4>
<p>Forgejo actions typically suggest using a specific runner, which come
preinstalled with Node.js and a bunch of other programs. We opted instead to build
our own base devuan images with our <a class="reference external" href="https://git.maemo.org/leste-cicd/devuan-base-containers">leste-cicd/devuan-base-containers</a> repository. We've
built images for <tt class="docutils literal">chimaera</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">daedalus</tt> and the freshly released <tt class="docutils literal">excalibur</tt>
release.</p>
<img alt="" src="/images/leste-cicd-container-registry.png" />
<p>Certain Forgejo actions normally require Node.js, but we decided not to leverage
that and instead using a Forgejo action written in shell, see
<a class="reference external" href="https://git.maemo.org/leste-cicd/checkout-action-nojs">leste-cicd/checkout-action-nojs</a> (forked
from <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/taiki-e/checkout-action">taiki-e/checkout-action</a>.</p>
<p>We created a custom action that uploads artifacts without requiring Node.js in
this repository: <a class="reference external" href="https://git.maemo.org/leste-cicd/upload-artifact-nojs">leste-cicd/upload-artifact-nojs</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="future-work">
<h4>Future work</h4>
<p>We will continue to develop our CI/CD system to make it easier to contribute to
Maemo Leste. In particular, we're looking to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>ensure that our CI/CD deals better with packages that are meant only to be
built for a specific architecture</li>
<li>contribute to Forgejo to make it easier for other projects to set up similar
CI/CD setups</li>
<li>ensure our CI/CD build-on-commit coverage extends to all our core packages</li>
<li>we can build device images in our CI/CD as opposed to in Jenkins by leveraging
debos</li>
<li>Provide better integration with our Weblate translation setup</li>
</ul>

<h3>Debos</h3>
<p>We're looking to modernise our image building process to make it easier to port
Maemo Leste to other devices. <tt class="docutils literal">erebion</tt> has made a start on utiling the debos
recipies as used to Mobian and adopting them for Maemo. We've been building on
his work and almost have bootable images for the Droid 4, which would be a great
milestone. The current changeset can be found in <a class="reference external" href="https://git.maemo.org/MerlijnWajer/mobian-recipes">MerlijnWajer/mobian-recipes</a></p>

<h3>Raspberry Pi images</h3>
<p>We're working in getting the Raspberry Pi images to build again. Currently minor

<div class="section" id="what-s-next">
<h2>What's next</h2>
<p>Devuan recently released their version of Debian Trixie coined <a class="reference external" href="https://www.devuan.org/os/announce/excalibur-release-announce-2025-11-02">Excalibur</a> and
we are looking to rebase Maemo Leste onto this release soon. Moving to Excalibur
will probably mean we will move to Qt6 and towards Pipewire - away from
Pulseaudio.</p>
<p>Adding support for more devices is something we're also aiming to do soon - both
in terms of developer single board computers (like the Raspberry Pi and Olimex
OLinuXino devices) as well as actual phones and tablets. The developer single
board computers will make it easier for folks to develop and contribute (phones
do not always make for nice development devices)</p>
<p>We're also looking to seriously improve our developer documentation - how to
port and/or contribute packages, how to port Maemo Leste to new devices, how to
debug problems and so forth.</p>
