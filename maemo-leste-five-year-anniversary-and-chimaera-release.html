        <p>We're back with another overdue update, marking our five year anniversary as
well as the official Chimaera release. Apart from the upgrade to Chimeara /
Bullseye (from Beowulf / Buster), here are some other highlights:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Work has started on the user manual / user guide;</li>
<li>Continued work on supporting more devices;</li>
<li>Telepathy-based (VoIP and XMPP) voice calls are soon coming to sphone;</li>
<li>Modem and cellular data enabled by default on various devices;</li>
<li>Support for elogind login sessions;</li>
<li>Various quality of life fixes such as Qt theming improvements;</li>
<li>Better power management on the Nokia N900;</li>
<li>Camera application for the Pinephone, additional firmware;</li>
<li>Developers now have Nokia N900 phone calls working, but some integration and
bug fixing still remains;</li>
</ul>
<p>(Also check out our <a class="reference external" href="https://maemo-leste.github.io/maemo-leste-new-year-update-may-2022-january-2023.html">previous update</a> in case you missed it).</p>
<div class="section" id="devuan-chimaera-debian-bullseye">
<h2>Devuan Chimaera (Debian Bullseye)</h2>
<p>The upgrade to Devuan Chimaera (Debian Bullseye) has been a long time coming,
but it is finally here. We had been testing Maemo Leste based on Chimaera for
half a year already, but with this blog post the release (and switchover) is
official. The <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/bugtracker/milestone/24">Chimaera milestone ticket</a> lists all the
packages that were rebuilt and any of the changes made to them.</p>
<p>The upgrade brings new Linux kernels to various devices (6.1.x for the
Droid 4, Droid Bionic, Nokia N900 and Pinephone), as well as a switch to elogind
sessions. This was required for staying compatible with modern software, which
now often require some form of login session manager in order to function
properly (or at all).</p>
<p>Most of the supported devices will now also have their modem activated, as well
as having software to make phone calls and use mobile data present on the device,
providing a much more phone-like experience out of the box.</p>
<p>In fact, the more recent Chimaera images should allow users to make working
phone calls on the Pinephone, Motorola Droid 4, Motorola Bionic out of the box.
Even on the Nokia N900 calls are now working, but they still require some manual
work after the device has started. The author of this news post has been using
his Droid 4 as a daily driver for over half a year now.</p>
<p>The image builder can now build Chimaera images, see the following commits
(<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/image-builder/commit/ed150008c1981550e9673ebd9bb19cb28770d3c7">ed150008c</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/image-builder/commit/e7a672f9cb9bf46c427576a077bd365a96a5d403">e7a672f9</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/image-builder/commit/8f2dee2640e53ffec8c328f343c339ddf153a2c0">8f2dee26</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/image-builder/commit/c5ed472f5b2e585c5412ceb12c4f1f6e6ebf4ed3">c5ed472f</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/image-builder/commit/3438cadb2e84269f337749f87a0da21b260663b3">3438cadb</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/image-builder/commit/083cbfabffcdad4383117a28964775e156f2947b">083cbfab</a>).</p>
<p>Additionally, the image builder base operating system has also been upgraded to
Chimaera.</p>
<div class="section" id="upgrading">
<h3>Upgrading</h3>
<p>Users can perform a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">dist-upgrade</span></tt> from their Beowulf install to Chimaera, but
the process isn't well supported at this point, and we instead recommend
users to install a latest image. However, if one prefers to perform a
dist-upgrade, please ensure that your beowulf installation is up to date before
attempting to dist-upgrade to chimaera. This sequence of commands might get you
through the upgrade:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
apt dist-upgrade -o APT::Force-LoopBreak=true
dpkg-reconfigure --force gconf2
dpkg-reconfigure --force libgconf-2-4:armhf
apt --fix-broken install
apt dist-upgrade -o APT::Force-LoopBreak=true
</pre>
<p>But again, this is not recommended for novice users. However, <strong>this can be done
entirely 'live' on the phone, while keeping the UI enabled</strong>. Even after the
upgrade is complete, you can still use the phone to an extent - but you really
ought to reboot when it's done.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="elogind-and-xorg">
<h3>elogind and Xorg</h3>
<p>Xorg now runs as the <tt class="docutils literal">user</tt> user, and no longer as <tt class="docutils literal">root</tt>, as part of the
switch to (e)logind.</p>
<p>Initially the switch caused trouble because it was no longer possible to ensure
that both elogind and Xorg would close all the file descriptors to the input
devices, keeping the input devices awake. However, a new kernel mechanism was
introduced (the <tt class="docutils literal">inhibited</tt> property) to suspend input devices regardless of
whether they are kept open (see this <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/mce/pull/58">mce PR</a>) or not. Ironically, Maemo had support
for that previously (in the form of a <tt class="docutils literal">disable</tt> property in sysfs), but this
was removed by the upstream kernel because it was deemed an unclean mechanism,
only to re-implement it again, years later.</p>
<p>We also have some policy kit integration now, through the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/policykit-1-hildon">policykit-1-hildon</a> package.</p>
<p>DSME also saw some minor changes to be <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/dsme/commit/929cde639a74cecde58d1fdf86316daa51ea1e27">compatible with a login session</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="pulseaudio">
<h3>Pulseaudio</h3>
<p>The new Pulseaudio in Chimaera had significantly reworked their UCM2 support,
and as result our <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/bugtracker/issues/685">audio setup was completely broken</a>.
We took a deep dive and figured out what the problem was, only to find out that
the headphone plug detection was also broken. These problems have now been fixed
in commit <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/leste-config/commit/1d08e6cbaa4eb18d07fc7a29423ac0db1e98d536">1d08e6cb</a>
and commit <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/leste-config/commit/4b8851518d8d523065dc1bb12df8d368de9d0af2">4b885151</a></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="cpu-flags">
<h3>CPU flags</h3>
<p>We now also build packages in the Maemo repositories with NEON and Thumb2.
Most packages in Debian are already using Thumb2, but not all make use of NEON.
See issue <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/bugtracker/issues/691">#691</a> and the
jenkins-integration commits <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/jenkins-integration/commit/bf2ce8c3423ec12c13f086d1acf64959b073bfaf">bf2ce8c3</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/jenkins-integration/commit/75a8e3fbff361653c0fd01ff1db136b40ec62b80">75a8e3fb</a>
for more details.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="qtwebengine">
<h3>qtwebengine</h3>
<p>Unfortunately Qt Webengine has a hardcoded list of Qt platform plugins that it
will attempt to use 3D acceleration on, so we have had to patch qt web engine
to ensure that it also uses 3D acceleration on the Maemo platform plugin.</p>
<p>See <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste-upstream-forks/qtwebengine/commit/c1fbfce8d8ea6c89f65fb8c884d506a39f717049">this patch to qtwebengine</a>
for more info. As a result many browsers will now run much more smoothly on Maemo Leste.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="syncevolution">
<h3>syncevolution</h3>
<p>The one regression we still have to figure out is syncevolution - as of writing the
package doesn't seem to work with its Maemo backends. Syncevolution went through
a major release, so we still have to figure out what exactly is broken.</p>
<p>We did port the Maemo Telepathy Backend to the new syncevolution version (to
have contacts integration), in commits <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/eds-backend-telepathy/commit/b96f28389554f2a1d39d6b8eeef3bd1a66e701fc">b96f28389</a>,

<div class="section" id="pinephone">
<h3>Pinephone</h3>
<p>On the Pinephone, the Pinhole/Shutter camera application should now let users
take pictures. See this <a class="reference external" href="https://leste.maemo.org/PinePhone#How_to_take_a_picture">wiki page</a> for more
information.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="nokia-n900">
<h3>Nokia N900</h3>
<p>The Nokia N900 has seen a lot of love from the community members. The power
management has improved a bunch (while not yet hitting the actual low power OMAP
modes), and a good battery will give one at least a day of uptime.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/leste-config/commit/f0de824b14ccf9070efae90d6dcb97b097ecb325">Blacklisting some modules</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/leste-config/commit/7dd372bf75b016c02a7acc13ddae928e722d2339">setting proper parameters on the 1-wire module</a> has significantly improved the battery life.</p>
<p>The FM transmitter module has also been enabled in the kernel, as well as some
additional features for the <tt class="docutils literal">iotop</tt> program to work properly (see <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/bugtracker/issues/706">issue #706</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/bugtracker/issues/703">issue #703</a>.</p>
<p>User <tt class="docutils literal">sicelo</tt> has improved the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/68fdbe090c362e8be23890a7333d156e18c27781">capacity evaluation of the battery</a>
in the upstream kernel, which permits <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/n900-pm/pull/1">simplifying</a> the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">n900-pm</span></tt> script.</p>
<p>User <tt class="docutils literal">arno II</tt> has contributed a UCM2 file for the Nokia N900, thereby much
improving the audio situation on the Nokia N900. He has reported that it can
also be used for phone calls when a few other pieces are integrated. The
earpiece doesn't work yet, but users should be able to use both the speakers or
headphones for calls.</p>
<p>The modem still needs to be loaded in a certain way for audio calls to work, and
the necessary changes for the <tt class="docutils literal">cmtspeech</tt> package and <tt class="docutils literal">pulseaudio</tt>
configuration are still under development.</p>
<p>For the next update, users can expect that phone calls will work normally and
properly.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="volume-control">
<h3>Volume control</h3>
<p>The volume applet has been improved to ensure that it now also <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/bugtracker/issues/615">works on the
Pinephone</a>. The right
audio sinks are now detected automatically, rather than being hardcoded per
device, see <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/maemo-statusmenu-volume/pull/4">maemo-statusmenu-volume PR #4</a> and
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/maemo-statusmenu-volume/issues/3">maemo-statusmenu-volume issue #3</a>.</p>
<p>With the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/droid4-linux/commit/0e2611e5c6c952eded5e737189da219a8c2e1f48">volume keys remapped</a>,
and having received a UCM2 file, the volume applet now also works on the Nokia
N900:</p>

<h2>Core Software additions and changes</h2>
<div class="section" id="mafw-open-media-player">
<h3>mafw / (Open) Media Player</h3>
<p>We've been working on making Open Media Player (OMP) and its dependencies work
on Maemo Leste. At this point, the internet radio player works, and work is
underway to also be able to play files from the file system as well. This
involves porting mafw-tracker-source to the newer GNOME APIs and
<tt class="docutils literal">freemangordon</tt> has started working on this.</p>
<p>This is what the media player looks like when started:</p>
<img alt="" src="/images/omp-start.png" style="width: 576px; height: 324px;" />
<p>Listening to a radio stream:</p>
<img alt="" src="/images/omp-radio.png" style="width: 576px; height: 324px;" />
<p>Showing the details of a radio stream:</p>
<img alt="" src="/images/omp-radio-details.png" style="width: 576px; height: 324px;" />
<p>Adding a new radio stream:</p>
<img alt="" src="/images/omp-add-baroque.png" style="width: 576px; height: 324px;" />
<p>Portrait mode:</p>
<img alt="" src="/images/omp-portrait.png" style="width: 324px; height: 576px;" />
<p>Open Media Player is now available for installation from the Hildon Application
Manager.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="qt-5-styling">
<h3>Qt 5 styling</h3>
<p>Some of the Qt5 styling problems that were present on Maemo Leste in the past
have now been solved.</p>
<p>One of the problems was that some applications had (white) backgrounds that didn't
fit with the theme (this was particularly present in the clock application).
Another problem was that text wouldn't always contrast well with the background
- for example black text on a dark gray background.</p>
<p>Various widgets should now also <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/qtstyleplugins/commit/83aca5c8f2f69f5815307ebac0a65a9be5522d19">support scrolling by default</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="notifications">
<h3>Notifications</h3>
<p>Maemo now implements more of the XDG specification for notification patterns
such as the vibration property, but also in general notification ought to be
supported in a (much) better fashion. Previously not all XDG categories were
supported, but now many more are. This changes were added to
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/hildon-plugins-notify-sv">hildon-plugins-notify-sv</a> version <tt class="docutils literal">0.64</tt>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="telepathy">
<h3>Telepathy</h3>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/sphone/pull/4">Work is underway</a> to add a
Telepathy module to our sphone application. This would then allow making regular
phone calls through Telepathy - as well as XMPP and SIP phone calls. The current
work can already be used to make phone calls, but for outgoing calls the
&quot;privacy&quot; bit is unconditionally being set, which means that the receiving
caller won't be able to see your phone number. XMPP and SIP phone calls start,
but the audio isn't being routed properly yet.</p>
<p>Having sphone use Telepathy is important, because then we can finally start
sending and receiving SMS messages from the Conversations application.</p>
<p>This work will be completed by the next news post.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, enjoy a screenshot showing SIP messages being exchanged between two
Maemo Leste users using Conversations.</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="documentation-user-manual">
<h2>Documentation: User Manual</h2>
<p>As part of the funding, we have been working on improving our documentation and
created a user manual. It is still being worked on and we haven't decided on a
place for it yet, but the <a class="reference external" href="http://maemo-leste-manual.motionlibre.org/">manual can be found here</a>.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://gitlab.com/motionlibre1/maemo-leste-user-handbook">source code for the manual</a> is also available.</p>
<p>Cornel-Florentin, who has worked on the documentation extensively has described
the approach below:</p>
<p><em>&quot;What we planned to do was first of all to have quite explanatory instructions
about how to navigate through the OS's interface, since most people nowadays are
pretty much used to the navigation concepts of Android and Apple devices. And
since Maemo Leste's interface is different, we thought that this would be the
most important aspect about improving user experience, and expectations.</em></p>
<p><em>Another important aspect of user friendliness is customization, to make users
feel more like home, and this was also prioritized.</em></p>
<p><em>To make it very clear to understand all the above mentioned aspects, and not
only, almost every detail was accompanied by many screenshots, which actually is
what took a big part of the time required writing this manual.</em></p>
<p><em>Besides, what also helps to to adjusting users' expectations is a section
dedicated to the known bugs, or elements which don't work as expected. Many
items here most likely will be short-lived, as they will be solved during the
following development stages, but mentioning them is very important, for the
reasons given above.</em></p>
<p><em>Another important part, before starting  writing, was to think about its
structure, in order to have it work as a reference too, and so to fit both
beginners and more experienced users. This was reworked and rethought a number
of times, as progressing, obviously also requiring a serious amount of time. And
it's not final, since it might still be modified in the future. It's the living
part of the manual, and the under development state of Maemo Leste, which keep
it transforming.</em></p>
<p><em>Having a good structure allows linking and crosslinking different parts,
sections and subsections, enabling packing the documentation in a more compact
form, which is easier to follow, grasp, modify and add to in the future. Finding
and jumping to the section you're looking for is also much easier this way.</em></p>
<p><em>Another structurally beneficial thing is having a glossary of technical terms,
so that again, advanced users to not have to crawl through text, skipping
trivial information, while at the same time beginners to not feel lost.</em></p>
<p><em>The manual is still work in progress, but by following the provided links you
can check the already completed parts, which are already considered to be done,
but which will still be revised at least one more time before they will go into
a final state. Any suggestions and corrections are welcome, so that we can
integrate them in the revised versions.&quot;</em></p>

<h3>DORS/CLUC 2023</h3>
<p>Maemo Leste gave a talk at DORS/CLUC. There doesn't seem to be a recording
online yet, but one can look at the <a class="reference external" href="https://wizzup.org/maemo-leste-dors-cluc-2023.pdf">PDF of the presentation</a> - there isn't any
particular news in the presentation though - the aim was to raise awareness.</p>
<p>We also had a stand and showed off Maemo Leste hardware to various folks.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="extra-packages">
<h3>Extra packages</h3>
<p>Various new packages were added by the community. Some are described in this at
length, others like <a class="reference external" href="https://leste.maemo.org/Extras/MStarDict">MStarDict</a> have
a wiki page that explain how they work. <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste-extras/harbour-amazfish">harbour-amazfish</a> was ported over from
SailfishOS.</p>
<div class="section" id="maemo-weather">
<h4>Maemo Weather</h4>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">Sander (dsc)</tt> has built a weather application in Qt called <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste-extras/NOMWeather">NOMWeather</a>. It looks great and is very
usable - you can find some screenshots of the application below.</p>

<div class="section" id="maemo-offline-translate">
<h4>Maemo (Offline) Translate</h4>
<p>Mozilla recently created a browser extension called
<a class="reference external" href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/firefox-translations/">firefox-translations</a>
which translates webpages from one language to another <em>without</em> using a
third-party service. The translation happens locally, in the browser, via
language models created using machine-learning.</p>
<p>Since this browser extension is open-source, <tt class="docutils literal">Sander (dsc)</tt> wondered if he could port
this translation engine to Maemo Leste for use as a standalone GUI application
for quality <strong>offline</strong> translation. This meant porting and packaging the
underlying machine learning technologies for low-powered ARM devices (like the
Droid 4) which turned out to be a challenging, but not impossible task.</p>
<!-- ![https://plak.infrapuin.nl/selif/22275ry4.jpg](https://plak.infrapuin.nl/selif/22275ry4.jpg) -->
<p>The end result is a responsive GUI that offers quick translations.</p>

<img alt="" src="/images/maemo-translate-deen.png" style="width: 576px; height: 324px;" />
<p>Maemo translate is now available from the repository as <cite>maemo-translate</cite>. In
addition, check out the individual language packs in the Hildon Application
Manager or via <cite>apt search maemo-translate-data</cite></p>

<h4>Windows 7 theme</h4>
<p>We have ported the old <a class="reference external" href="http://maemo.org/packages/view/windows7-theme/">Maemo Windows 7 theme</a> - see the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste-extras/windows7-theme">windows7-theme</a> extras repository for
the source. It can now be installed on your Maemo Leste devices. Find below some
screenshots of what it looks like:</p>
