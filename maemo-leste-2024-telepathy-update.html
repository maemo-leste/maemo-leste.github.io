        <p>It's been a good while since our last update, but not for the lack of changes -
indeed, we've been busy bees. Some of the highlights:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Big communication (Telepathy) upgrade;</li>
<li>Graphics rendering artifacts fixed on all mapphones;</li>
<li>Much improved phone calls on several devices;</li>
<li>Integration of Gnome Tracker and the Open Media Player;</li>
<li>Support for more devices;</li>
<li>Improvements to our user guide and documentation;</li>
<li>Significant changes to our browser (Jib);</li>
</ul>
<p>(Also check out our <a class="reference external" href="https://maemo-leste.github.io/maemo-leste-five-year-anniversary-and-chimaera-release.html">previous update</a> in case you missed it).</p>
<div class="section" id="hardware-drivers">
<h2>Hardware &amp; Drivers</h2>
<p>We have moved to a new Linux LTS release - 6.6.x and after fixing various
regressions (no call audio at all, cpu frequency issues and other instabilities)
are now in an even better spot when it comes to hardware support
through the new features brought by this Linux release - in particular for call
audio.</p>
<div class="section" id="graphics">
<h3>Graphics</h3>
<p>We have had minor rendering bugs on the mapphone phones (Droid 4, Droid Bionic,
Droid Razr, etc) which were mostly prevalent in font rendering. This problem has
been fixed in <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/leste-config/commit/9acc40b173ba4ede851f83f127e6e5c50306573b">leste-config version 1.103</a>!</p>
<p>Additionally, we have improved the 16-bit mode of xf86-video-omap so that the xv
video scaling works properly. This is helpful because the Nokia N900 uses 16 bit
Xorg. We've also improved the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/xf86-video-omap/commit/4e5aead5403f4c9e594fc9c1e3b9ac5afae182ad">compositing</a> as well as <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/xf86-video-omap/commit/92eb692c2d1f8b743b7b56c88616f0f2e41b822d">two</a> <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/xf86-video-omap/commit/ace9cda2a22a4b032ff82cc6761485945fffd55c">other</a> stability fixes.</p>
<p>hildon-desktop (the Maemo window manager) also has a 30% speed improvement in
the application launcher by <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/hildon-desktop/commit/51b5a4b0cbe046bfc7cd5d4b028676344ad92bb8">calculating the saturation in the shader just once</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="connectivity">
<h3>Connectivity</h3>
<p>The cellular data code has improved, particularly in the provisioning (<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/libicd-network-ofono/commit/920429ada67a8ffe7a5384169a8a9ab3c28fa5a8">commit 920429ad</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/libicd-network-ofono/commit/ffa7b91ce39fd9e35fbf8db715ff">commit ffa7b91c</a> which fix <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/bugtracker/issues/555">issue

<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">libicd-network-wpasupplicant</span></tt> now properly updates the wireless signal
strength with <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/libicd-network-wpasupplicant/pull/2">libicd-network-wpasupplicant pull request #2</a>.</p>
<p>We have also packaged the latest wpa_supplicant version, which would allow using
hostapd for mobile hotspots, but unfortunately this doesn't work currently with
Linux 6.6, only with Linux 6.1.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="audio-and-call-audio">
<h3>Audio and Call Audio</h3>
<p>The call audio has improved a bunch both for all the mapphones and the Nokia
N900. We have also made some general audio improvements.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/maemo-audio/commit/ecbae1b12cfdfe10b3e144536a1294e534b266c1">Pulseaudio was switched to a user daemon</a>
instead of a system daemon, as recommended by pulseaudio upstream.</p>
<p>Regular audio would sometimes stop working after a phone call was made using the
device, this has now been resolved by <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/leste-config/commit/1febfa7d6f7373150afad5785103734f99439ab4">reducing the shared memory of each
pulseaudio connection</a>.</p>
<p>On the mapphone devices the call audio has become a lot more stable by removing
some of the hacks we've had in the kernel previously and using the new
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">audio-graph-card2</span></tt> framework in the kernel, which allows defining audio routes in a way
that we couldn't before. (The Droid 4 and other devices rely on cpcap to manage
the audio routes and requires not active ALSA connection, and we could not
express that before.). For more details check the following commits:
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/droid4-linux/commit/efca4073912c3051e495f3afe40225f74a0c2dc0">commit efca4073</a>,

<p>On the Nokia N900 side, voice calls were finally integrated, and call audio has
also been incrementally improved thanks to work by <tt class="docutils literal">arno11</tt>, with <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/leste-config/pull/48">support for headsets</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/leste-config/commit/11f11dac690ee752900f144ecff809a8991d14c3">support for the earpiece</a>,

</div>
<div class="section" id="miscellaneous-updates">
<h3>Miscellaneous updates</h3>
<p>After moving to Linux 6.6, the cpu frequency options disappeared. We traced it
down to a regression which we have reported upstream and temporarily worked
around by making the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/droid4-linux/commit/20d360a9da5a5450117ca9bcae436352c1e81bd6">cpufreq device tree platform device built in</a>
(as opposed to a kernel module).</p>
<p>Maemo Fremantle supported the feature where you could silence audible
notifications such as incoming calls, or alarms, by turning the device face-down.
This feature is now supported in Maemo Leste as well, through
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/mce/pull/61">https://github.com/maemo-leste/mce/pull/61</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/mce/pull/62">https://github.com/maemo-leste/mce/pull/62</a>,
and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste-upstream-forks/iio-sensor-proxy/pull/2">https://github.com/maemo-leste-upstream-forks/iio-sensor-proxy/pull/2</a>. The
face-down reporting feature has also been submitted to upstream <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">iio-sensor-proxy</span></tt>
and could be used for other Linux mobile distros in future.</p>

<div class="section" id="devices">
<h2>Devices</h2>
<div class="section" id="nokia-n900">
<h3>Nokia N900</h3>
<p>We have been working hard on improving the performance on the Nokia N900 and
<tt class="docutils literal">sicelo</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">arno11</tt> in particular have contributed many fixes.</p>
<p>The N900 now runs in <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/leste-config/pull/44">16bit Xorg mode</a> to improve the
performance of the X server. <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/droid4-linux/pull/6">Turbo mode and overclock frequencies</a> have been
added as well, allowing for a much more smooth experience. We're still trying to
find the best scheduler, as the default ondemand scheduler doesn't perform
particularly well when it comes to having a responsive device.</p>
<p>We've also been toying with <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/leste-config/pull/50">tweaking the default hildon transitions file</a> which
controls what the window manager transitions look like, which effects are used
and so on. In particular we're trying to see what the best settings will be for
a responsive device. In the process we've also been further improving the
performance of hildon-desktop.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">sicelo</tt> has added support for Nokia N900's ofono to fetch <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste-upstream-forks/ofono/pull/4">extra details about
the operator</a>, such as the
name. He has also fixed the issue where the N900 battery icon never hit the
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/bugtracker/issues/167">fully charged state</a>, which affects both the
status icon as well as the LED behaviour. This is now fixed in mce and our
kernel in <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/droid4-linux/pull/9/commits">droid4-linux PR #9</a>, and are already
upstreamed to mainline linux.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">sicelo</tt> has also fixed a potential crash in <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/gps-nokia-n900/pull/1">gps-nokia-n900 PR #1</a> and also ensured that
the GPS date is correct since the epoch rollover in 2019 in <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/gps-nokia-n900/pull/2">gps-nokia-n900 PR
#2</a>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, <tt class="docutils literal">sicelo</tt> has also added support for the <a class="reference external" href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/hadess/iio-sensor-proxy/-/merge_requests/375">N900 'switch-type'
proximity sensor in iio-sensor-proxy</a>.
To top it off, he has also corrected the accelerometer orientation to correctly
report face up and face down in <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/droid4-linux/pull/11">droid-linux PR #4</a>.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">arno11</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">freemangordon</tt> have also been working on infra red support,
have been ensuring that the Linux kernel wide is working and reportedly have
the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste-extras/pierogi">pierogi GUI</a> working on
the N900. The necessary patches will have landed in Linux 6.8, so when we move
to the next Linux LTS kernel we will have working infra red.</p>
<p>We've also ensured that the microphone works for regular (non-call) audio
in <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/leste-config/pull/51">leste-config PR #51</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="pinephone">
<h3>Pinephone</h3>
<p>We ensured that the earpiece in calls isn't too loud in <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/leste-config/pull/37">leste-config PR #37</a>. Otherwise, there
haven't been that many updates to the Pinephone this time around -- but it works
well for phone calls and SMS, runs pretty stable and is fun to use with the
physical keyboard.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="mapphones">
<h3>Mapphones</h3>
<p>Most of the improvements to the mapphones have been in the form of making the
audio calls work better and fixing the graphical glitches as well as by adding
new mapphone devices. One other change however is fixing the 'hidden caller id'
feature being inverted (so when one would request to be hidden it wouldn't be,
and vice versa) - this was solved in <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste-upstream-forks/ofono/pull/2">maemo-leste-upstream-forks/ofono PR #12</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="new-devices">
<h3>New devices</h3>
<p>We have added images for a lot of new devices, the Motorola <em>RAZR XT910 and XT912</em>,
the Motorola <em>Atrix 2</em> and the XYBoard <em>MZ609/MZ617</em> <strong>tablet</strong>.</p>
<div class="section" id="razr-xt910-xt912">
<h4>RAZR XT910 / XT912</h4>
<p>We now support the Motorola RAZR XT910 and XT912. Most features should just work
and the battery life is pretty decent. There is still a screen corruption bug that
we have to investigate.</p>
<p>The relevant <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/arm-sdk/commit/ae9f3c25d269a1521c670373a3a6fd88cdb14f11">arm-sdk change</a>

can be found here. The kernel changes are more complicated and spread out over
several commits, so we would encourage interested users to look directly at our

<div class="section" id="droid-3">
<h4>Droid 3</h4>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://maedevu.maemo.org/images/droid3/">Droid 3 images</a> are now available.
See the <a class="reference external" href="https://leste.maemo.org/Motorola_Droid_3">Droid 3 wiki page</a> for more
information. There seems to be some instability when the GPU is clocked too
high, so we're looking into lowering the GPU clock speed and voltage to see if
that will get rid of the instability problems.</p>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal">solana</tt> branch of <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/MerlijnWajer/bionic-clown-boot">this bionic-clown-boot fork</a> works for the Droid 3.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="atrix-2">
<h4>Atrix 2</h4>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://maedevu.maemo.org/images/bionic/">Atrix 2 images</a> are now available
in the form of Bionic images - there is a lot of overlap between the two phones
which means that these images should mostly just work.</p>
<p>The Atrix 2 seems to be the AT&amp;T version of the Bionic (which used the Verizon
network). The modem seems to be on SPI instead of USB, which provides additional
challenges.</p>
<p>We will provide more specialised images (and a wiki page with instructions) in
the near future. Make sure to downgrade to this <a class="reference external" href="https://maedevu.maemo.org/images/atrix2/">Android
(InlineFlashing_Edison_67.21.125_CFC_P3_APBP.xml.zip) release</a> before flashing bionic-clown-boot,
and change the installation script to store the installation not on the
<tt class="docutils literal">/sdcard</tt> but on <tt class="docutils literal">/data/clown</tt> (and create said directory). If you're
worried you might make a mistake - just wait for the wiki page to surface in the
coming weeks!</p>

<div class="section" id="xyboard-tablets">
<h4>xyboard tablets</h4>
<p>One of the more exciting device ports is the MZ608/MZ609/MZ615/MZ616/MZ617 (or
just commonly known as xoom2/xyboard tablets) port. Most of these tablets do not
come with a micro SD card slot, which posed some additional challenges to us,
since most of our device installs have always been to (micro) SD cards.</p>
<p>The xyboard tablets come in different variants with either 16GB of storage of
32GB of storage. However, there is no way to flash Maemo Leste directly to the
data partition, so one has to install the right version of the droid4-kexecboot
and then flash the special <strong>mz617-tiny-bootstrap</strong> image to a flashable
partition (like <tt class="docutils literal">cdrom</tt>) which will then boot to a minimal Maemo. Using this
minimal Maemo, one can then flash (using rsync) the Leste image root partition
to the /data/ partition. The process is rather involved, but a wiki page will
follow this news announcement in the coming weeks with detailed installation
instructions.</p>
<p>The tiny image was created specifically for the xyboard tablet and this required
quite some changes. We introduced a new meta package called <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/hildon-meta/commit/657045b6d5e5a50c7566dd6232663a9ca5c1163e">hildon-meta-core</a>
which contained only the bare minimal required for Maemo Leste to function. We
then <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/hildon-meta/commit/f49d49bdcbd8b2ac46c341a0039597d799e76a9f">trimmed it some more</a>
to further reduce the required disk space.</p>
<p>Then we added a special flag to the image-builder to <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/image-builder/commit/566a74d48b6fb19c9545322f4052072428022f76">build tiny images</a>
which will remove manual pages and other unnecessary files that are hard to
prune otherwise and set <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/image-builder/commit/34a747a1b55631403b66a3f538601f6b89b5909c">only one locale</a>.
The end result is that we end up with an image that is about ~700MB, which fits
in one of the smaller but flashable partitions of Android on the xyboards.</p>
<p>We, of course, also <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/hildon-meta/commit/10123d888eac654e6374f45b04accc383e942a98">added a meta package</a>.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that if one <strong>bricks the MZ617</strong> it will be very hard to
recover, since we have not been able to find the right files that allow us to
flash all partitions - so beware.</p>
<p>In general, the device port works well - it is really fun to run Maemo on a real
tablet. There are still improvements to be made to the power management as the
device does not idle correctly yet. Once the device idles correctly we believe
we should get multiple-days uptime without problems.</p>

<h2>Telepathy &amp; Communications</h2>
<p>The biggest update this time around is to our Telepathy-based communication
stack with the addition of various features and protocols. We currently support
the following protocols to varying degrees: XMPP, Matrix, SIP, IRC, Telegram,
Facebook, Slack and Discord. Most of these protocols also have a corresponding
accounts plugin to configure them.</p>
<img alt="" src="/images/ham-accounts.png" style="width: 576px; height: 324px;" />
<p>And the different accounts can be used to group contacts in the Contacts
application:</p>

<div class="section" id="telepathy-haze-pidgin-libpurple">
<h3>telepathy-haze (pidgin/libpurple)</h3>
<p>The telepathy-haze connection manager can load Pidgin/libpurple plugins, which
allows us to use Pidgin plugins from Maemo Leste's contacts and conversations
applications. This thus allows us to use libpurple plugins for which no 'native'
telepathy connection managers exist.</p>
<p>Until recently telepathy-haze lacked support for channels/rooms, which means
only 1:1 messages worked.  <tt class="docutils literal">freemangordon</tt> has added support in
<a class="reference external" href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/telepathy/telepathy-haze/-/merge_requests/4/">telepathy-haze MR #4</a>.

<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste-upstream-forks/telepathy-haze">maemo-leste-upstream-forks/telepathy-haze</a>, and we

<div class="section" id="telepathy-tank-matrix">
<h3>telepathy-tank (Matrix)</h3>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">Sander</tt> worked on improving the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste-upstream-forks/telepathy-tank">telepathy-tank</a> Matrix
connection manager, which uses <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/quotient-im/libQuotient">libQuotient</a>.</p>
<p>The following has been added:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Support for creating, joining and leaving Matrix rooms (both 1:1 <em>and</em> groupchat)</li>
<li>Detecting the room name and detecting if other devices leave the room</li>
<li>Support for end to end encrypted chats (previously messages would just not be
received at all)</li>
</ul>
<p>While these added features are stable, we are still working on getting the code tidied
up and the changes upstreamed. For example, the Matrix contacts do not show up in the address book
just yet - we're investigating why this would be the case, it might be a problem in our
address book rather than in the Telepathy connection manager implementation.</p>
<p>The code can be found in the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste-upstream-forks/telepathy-tank/tree/groupchat-e2e">groupchat-e2e</a>
branch.</p>
<p>We have also created a <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste-extras/rtcom-accounts-plugin-matrix/">UI to configure a Matrix account</a>, for

<h3>telepathy-ring</h3>
<p>telepathy-ring, the ofono (regular calls) connection manager has been added to
our list of upstream forks to ensure that the right mission-control plugin gets
installed, which in turns makes sure that the telepathy-ring account is online
even when there is no internet (since cellular calls work fine without
internet). This setting is controlled by the 'always_dispatch' bit in Telepathy,
and it took us quite a while to figure out how this was supposed to work.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conversations">
<h3>Conversations</h3>
<p>Conversations has seen significant improvements since our last news update,
amongst other things:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>support for sending and receiving SMSes now that the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/sphone/pull/4">sphone voicecall manager
module was merged</a>;</li>
<li>multi window support;</li>
<li>working (persistent) notifications, including on the lock screen;</li>
<li>support for 'chat state' which will help connection managers determine when a
message has been seen;</li>
<li>support for group chats including auto-joining channels;</li>
<li>drastically lowered memory usage (35 MB idle memory on the overview screen, 45MB with a chat window opened);</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/conversations/issues/8">fast, full text search in all your messages</a>;</li>
<li>initial address book integration;</li>
<li>a large refactor of the telepathy client side code;</li>
<li>the ability to clear and delete chats;</li>
<li>the ability to <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/conversations/issues/3">export chats</a>;</li>
<li>various graphical changes to improve the user-experience;</li>
</ul>
<p>The main missing feature right now is the ability to start a <strong>new</strong> chat
directly from conversations: <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/conversations/issues/10">composing a new message</a>. Currently one has to
go through the address book and start sending a message from there. We are aware
that this is a severe limitation (especially for SMSes) and will address this shortly.</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="sphone">
<h3>sphone</h3>
<p>The biggest addition to sphone has been the addition of the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/sphone/pull/8">voicecall-manager
plugin</a> which makes sphone
support audio calls using the Telepathy framework (orchestrated by <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste-upstream-forks/voicecall/">Sailfish
OS voicecall daemon</a>). The reason that
this addition is huge is because this allows us to switch SMS and calls over the
Telepathy (which means that <a class="reference internal" href="#conversations">Conversations</a> can now handle SMses) and also
because it allows us to make SIP and XMPP audio calls using the Telepathy framework.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">uvos</tt> has contributed various core sphone changes to support the
voicecall-manager and has most recently worked on enabling DTMF support within
sphone. <tt class="docutils literal">freemangordon</tt> has made sure that the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">vcard-field</span></tt> <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/sphone/pull/6#event-10594544989">gets stored in
the events database</a>.</p>
<p>The option to make <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/sphone/pull/5">phone calls in landscape mode</a> has also been added to accommodate
the Nokia N900, which currently doesn't support portrait mode screen rotation.</p>

<div class="section" id="media">
<h2>Media</h2>
<p>In our previous post we introduced the Maemo Open Media Player. This updates
brings a lot of improvements to the media player, in particular when it comes to
performance and stability. However, the single biggest change is that open media
player will now actually find and play music stored on your device (instead of
just internet radio streams). This was achieved by a significant porting of
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">mafw-tracker-source</span></tt> to newer frameworks.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/mafw-tracker-source">mafw-tracker-source</a> is
the component that then uses gnome-tracker to deliver the files as input to the
open media player and has also received many changes (<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/mafw-tracker-source/commits/master/">too many to list here</a>), but the
most important improvements are improved tracker ordering and better performance.</p>
<img alt="" src="/images/omp-start-screen.png" style="width: 576px; height: 324px;" />
<img alt="" src="/images/omp-play-music.png" style="width: 576px; height: 324px;" />
<p>In particular, the gnome-tracker which is used to index your files (and identify
them as songs) received a lot of stability fixes and speed improvements. In some
cases, fixes were never backported. The most common occurrence was that tracker
wouldn't ever actually complete and start up indexing things all over again.</p>
<p>In particular, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste-upstream-forks/tracker-miners/commit/0ac3ba4e88b38d2d006286a34cf6c72da9311409">these</a> <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste-upstream-forks/tracker/commit/db6e3b5fe439cafc288d313e55697d6128212067">three</a> <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste-upstream-forks/tracker/commit/88bb88a2e5a45cdf0cb5346e04f389922b42d022">commits</a> were all essential to the stability.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">uvos</tt> has fixed the 'car view' screen (this was broken previously) and

<p>The address book will now also properly show the ability to perform an audio or
video call to a XMPP contact if they are online and added as a contact - this
required a <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/eds-backend-telepathy/commit/78e47143060efe736ea0414ccebe6e73a188aa00">fix to eds-backend-telepathy</a>

Debian submenu. This has now been addressed in <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/hildon-desktop/pull/23">hildon-desktop PR #23</a>.</p>
<p>hildon-desktop now also supports multiple shortcuts for a single action which
solves <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/bugtracker/issues/528">issue #528</a>.</p>
<p>The hildon-status-menu now allows for multiple icons per status menu plugin,
implemented in <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/hildon-status-menu/pull/4">hildon-status-menu PR #4</a>. This allows us to
render multiple icons for example for when a device has multiple sim cards or
has multiple batteries.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/libhildonmime/pull/5">libhildonmime PR #5</a>
extends libhildonmime to properly fallback to xdg-open.</p>
<p>The terminal application now also has a setting to disable changing the font
when the volume keys are pressed, see <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/osso-xterm/pull/4">osso-xterm PR #4</a>.</p>
<p>DSME, the device state management entity has gained support for using <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/dsme/commit/c6aa4ef1cb4d9ea8334ed23b6bebb975a523c0bf">elogind
to restart or shutdown the device</a>
so that the action is coordinated more effectively to the rest of the system.</p>

<h2>Synchronisation</h2>
<p>Since the migration to Chimaera, synchronising contacts and address books was
seemingly broken. Embarassingly, it turned out that yours truly forgot to
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/syncevolution/commit/14bf3f262d39748ced70a6460bd1bd25053a40a4">enable building</a>
the Maemo backend of syncevolution with the migration, and once the backend was
flipped on and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/syncevolution/commit/149b3db06d02dd3a020b745039df4e4b8b5548b6">a few compilation errors were fixed</a>
synchronisation once again started working.</p>
<p>If you haven't set up synchronisation, check out the <a class="reference external" href="https://leste.maemo.org/Sync">Sync</a> page on the wiki.</p>

<div class="section" id="translations-and-localisation">
<h2>Translations and localisation</h2>
<p>Since Maemo Leste has been on weblate to crowdsource translations of the
operating system, many users had actually contributed translations. However,
manual labour was still involved in getting the new translations built and
deployed, and with the help of some automation this has now been done for the
50+ translation repositories that all saw contributions.</p>
<p>Some of our own core applications do not yet support localisation (like
<a class="reference internal" href="#conversations">Conversations</a>, but we aim to add that soon).</p>

<h3>Maemo (Offline) Translate</h3>
<p>Maemo Translate now supports additional languages with this
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste-extras/maemo-translate-data/commit/ff97e527568e4167e28299e9ea501bc74deb729d">maemo-translate-data commit</a> - importing the latest models from <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mozilla/firefox-translations-models">firefox-translation-models</a>.</p>
<p>We also created a script to <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste-extras/maemo-translate-data/commit/399d55d72e6cbc05ab3023eec2354ece214638f8">automatically make new releases</a> based on
firefox-translation-models should we want to do a new release.</p>
<p>This adds offline translation support for the following languages:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Danish</li>
<li>Greek</li>
<li>Finnish</li>
<li>Croatian</li>
<li>Hungarian</li>
<li>Indonesian</li>
<li>Lithuanian</li>
<li>Latvian</li>
<li>Romanian</li>
<li>Slovak</li>
<li>Slovenian</li>
<li>Serbian</li>
<li>Turkish</li>
<li>Vietnamese</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these languages can be installed separately. One can also use the
meta package to install all of the languages.</p>
<p>Note that in addition to using the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste-extras/maemo-translate">Maemo Translation GUI</a>, translations can be done programmatically by
linking against <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste-extras/kotki/tree/7c9db3bd3bfe1c9e3602811b3734d6d2f215e012?tab=readme-ov-file#c">libkotki</a>.</p>

<h3>OTP</h3>
<p>The Maemo &quot;OTP&quot; program (perhaps to be renamed Maemo Authenticator in the
future) now <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste-extras/maeotp/pull/7">supports the more common base32 and hex encoded keys</a>. This allows
one to use the OTP program for 2-factor authentication with most services:
Github, Gitlab, and Pypi for example.</p>

<h3>DrNokSnes</h3>
<p>DrNokSnes, the SNES emulator is now working and packaged - thanks to <tt class="docutils literal">arno11</tt>.
This has been a very long time coming (over four years) - see <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maemo-leste/bugtracker/issues/331">issue #331</a> for some history.</p>

<h2>NGI Assure: NLnet Funding</h2>
<p>The NGI Assure that we applied to is finishing at the end of August, and we have
achieved most of our funding goals (but not all).  The NGI also invited us to a written interview, which can be <a class="reference external" href="https://ngi.eu/ngi-interviews/interview-with-merlijn-wajer-maemo-leste-ngi-assure-beneficiary/">read here on ngi.eu</a>.</p>

<div class="section" id="delayed-news-update">
<h2>Delayed news update</h2>
<p>For those who don't follow day-to-day activities of the project, it may appear as
if development has halted - at least judging from the frequency of news updates. Rest assured, this
couldn't be further from the truth. Development has progressed to the
point of Leste becoming production-ready, supporting many features one reasonably expects
from a mobile device.</p>
<p>Writing news updates just takes time, and is unfortunately not a task that is easily
delegated. In our case, it requires understanding of systems engineering which is highly
technical in nature. Thus, we'll sometimes delay news updates in favor of having
something substantial to present, and other times we're simply too busy hacking away
on the next cool feature.</p>
